# wholesale-customers

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding customer spending patterns using the Wholesale Customers Dataset. The dataset contains information about customers' annual spending across various product categories, and the goal is to segment customers, detect anomalies, and provide actionable insights through dimensionality reduction and clustering.

## Project Objectives
1.  **Preprocess and clean the data:** Handle duplicates, missing values, and normalize features.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** Identify and remove abnormal instances using statistical, distance-based, density-based, and machine learning techniques.
3.  **Clustering for Customer Segmentation:** Use clustering techniques like **DBSCAN** and **Hierarchical Clustering** to group similar customers.
4.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Apply **PCA** and **t-SNE** to visualize the clusters and analyze customer patterns.
